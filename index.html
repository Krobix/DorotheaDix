<h1>Dorothea Dix</h1>

<!--Timeline Placeholder-->

<div id="bio-intro" class="biosection">Dorothea Dix was an extremely significant reformer in the 1800’s. Although in her early years she would work as a teacher, she would eventually move on from this profession and begin her career as a reformer, specifically of prisons and asylums, where she would advocate for better living conditions for criminals as well as the mentally ill. Although her reforms were rejected and disliked by most government officials of her time, she never gave up on the core ideas of her cause, and her ideas would come to be embraced by many down the line.</div>

<div id="bio-earlylife" class="biosection">
    Dorothea Dix was born in Hampden, Maine, in 1802. While much of her early life is not known, it is known that it was very difficult, with her mother being depressed and unavailable and her father being an abusive alcoholic. Despite these misfortunes, her father was insistent that she learn to read and write, something that was not necessarily commonplace for women at the time, which led to her developing a great interest in having an education.

    Dorothea’s fortunes changed when she reached age 12 and moved to Boston, where her grandmother lived. Her grandmother was wealthy and encouraged Dorothea to continue her education. With this help, Dorothea would establish several schools in Boston and Worcester, designing her own curriculums and classes, all while still a teenager and (later on) a young adult.

<div id="bio-endteach" class="biosection">
    Dorothea’s career as a teacher would end up being repeatedly set back by her frequent bouts of illness in the 1820’s. As her health became worse, she would end up spending less and less time in the classroom, until 1836, when, at the age of 34, she shut down her last school, marking the final end of her career in teaching.

    During this same year, Dorothea’s physician suggested that she visit Europe. She did so with some friends, and while in Europe she met several activists who in particular advocated for more humane prisons. This sparked Dorothea’s interest in the subject, a subject which she planned to pursue when she arrived home. This would begin with her taking tours of prisons across the States after arriving home.
